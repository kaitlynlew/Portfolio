1. What is the work you’re taking on?

My Punch-up will be a jam board featured in the about me page of my portfolio. This idea is that you can draw doodles of whatever you want then export it. Below the jam board will be a fun interactive section where you can click to drag and move around different projects and designs I have worked on!


2. How do you think this is going to enhance your body of work? Will it be a new entry, or an interesting interaction?

I’m hoping that this interaction is something that people can have a fun time with while visiting my site, allowing people to express creativity. I want this part of my portfolio to show my passion for creativity by giving people a fun little playground to draw whatever they want!

3. Lo-fi mock-ups of the concept.

6. Any fears, uncertainties, doubts about the implementation.

As of right now, I’m not exactly sure how I’ll implement the feature where users can export their doodles, but I’ll make sure to do some research on it!
